## Interested in helping?

**There are 2 ways of helping**
1. You can **add more data to the country data inflation** pipeline to improve fidelity of the data. Check the `countryData` folder for more info
2. You can **participate in the development**, check the issues, they are organized in 2 milestones:
    -  **V1** is when this is Proof of Concept ready. It can be validated by an expert, so we know if our data is fine, if the approach is fine
    -  **V2** is our MVP, we can release it to the public, and become famous.
